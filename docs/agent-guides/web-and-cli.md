# Web And CLI

## Web UI

Layer rules, boundary rules, and agent-callback omissions live in `web/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Full design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-14-web-ui-design.md`.

Every browser-callable daemon route maps to one TypeScript function in `web/src/lib/api/`. Two paired tests enforce this:

- Python: `tests/contract/test_openapi_snapshot.py` pins OpenAPI to `tests/contract/openapi.json`. Regenerate intentional changes with `HAPPYRANCH_REGEN_OPENAPI=1 uv run pytest tests/contract/test_openapi_snapshot.py`.
- TypeScript: `web/src/test/openapi-coverage.test.ts` asserts every documented path is either included with a TS mirror or excluded with justification.

Build and dev commands:

```bash
scripts/build_web.sh
cd web && npm run dev
happyranch web
```

The SPA fetches the daemon bearer token once via `GET /api/v1/auth/bootstrap`, which is localhost-gated, then caches it in `sessionStorage` and attaches it to HTTP and SSE calls. CLI bearer-token behavior is unchanged.

## CLI

The CLI is an HTTP client. Start the daemon first.

```bash
scripts/daemon.sh start
scripts/daemon.sh status
scripts/daemon.sh stop
happyranch web [--no-open]
```

Slug resolution for per-org commands: explicit `--org <slug>` > `HAPPYRANCH_ORG_SLUG` > auto-infer only when exactly one org exists > error. Container-level commands take no `--org`.

Full founder-facing CLI docs: `skills/happyranch/SKILL.md`.

## Agent-Side Callbacks

These are invoked by skills inside agent sessions. Do not invoke them by hand; doing so falsifies audit data.

- `happyranch report-completion`
- `happyranch progress`
- `happyranch learning {add,update,promote,reindex}`
- `happyranch manage-agent`
- `happyranch manage-repo`
- `happyranch dispatch`
- `happyranch threads {reply,decline,dispatch}`

Callbacks should use `--from-file <path>` where payloads have multiple fields. See `docs/agent-guides/agent-executors-and-permissions.md`.
