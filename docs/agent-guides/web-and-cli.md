# Web And CLI

## Web UI

Layer rules, boundary rules, and agent-callback omissions live in `web/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Full design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-14-web-ui-design.md`.

Every browser-callable daemon route maps to one TypeScript function in `web/src/lib/api/`. Two paired tests enforce this:

- Python: `tests/contract/test_openapi_snapshot.py` pins OpenAPI to `tests/contract/openapi.json`. Regenerate intentional changes with `HAPPYRANCH_REGEN_OPENAPI=1 uv run pytest tests/contract/test_openapi_snapshot.py`.
- TypeScript: `web/src/test/openapi-coverage.test.ts` asserts every documented path is either included with a TS mirror or excluded with justification.

### Settings dialog

The Settings dialog opens from the TopBar gear button. It shows:

- **System** (read-only) — daemon-wide settings (CLI paths, session timeout default, orchestration limits) with restart-required badges.
- **Org** (editable, Phase 2) — org-level settings: session timeout override, dreaming schedule (enabled, schedule time/timezone, catch-up-on-startup, agent mode, include/exclude agent names), threads config (enabled, default turn cap, invocation timeout), and **working_hours** (THR-035: the Work-Hours Config UI — feature on/off switch, org-level eligibility selector, and the raw per-tier schedule blocks `default` / `teams` / `overrides`).

**Backend routes:**

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/orgs/{slug}/settings` | Read-only System + Org snapshot (includes the raw per-tier `working_hours` blocks for the reconciliation view) |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/orgs/{slug}/settings/org` | Partial-update editable Org settings |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/orgs/{slug}/settings/teams` | Worker-membership editing for teams |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/orgs/{slug}/work-hours/next-wakes` | Preview the next N wake timestamps for an agent's resolved effective schedule |

The serializer is an allow-list: no secret fields (permission_mode, codex_sandbox_mode, feishu credentials, daemon bind/port, allow_rules) are ever serialized. `extra='forbid'` on the PUT body rejects unknown/sensitive keys with 422. `save_org_config` deep-merges only allow-listed keys (`dreaming`, `threads`, `session_timeout_seconds`, `working_hours`) and carries through all unmanaged blocks verbatim. Tests recursively assert key-safety invariants (`tests/daemon/test_routes_settings.py`).

**Work-Hours Config (THR-035):** `working_hours` writes reuse the existing validate-then-atomic-write path in `save_org_config` — the candidate config is validated by `_build_org_config` / `_parse_working_hours` (the same path config-load uses), so an invalid config can never reach disk; the last-known-good keeps running. `enabled` is a single feature-level switch (never a per-tier or per-agent leaf); eligibility (`agents`) is a single org-level gate. A pre-flight validates working_hours agent/team names against the live roster (422 on unknown) before any write. Every working_hours write emits an audit row scoped to `config:working_hours` (who/when/before→after/tiers) via `AuditLogger.log_org_config_write` — reusing the established generic-scope-id convention on `audit_log.task_id` (no column change, no real-TASK-id overload). Validation is server-authoritative; the client does cheap format hints only. Routine-task editing is **read-only in MVP** (Phase 2 is the agent-contract-file write surface).

**Hot-reload:** Changes apply on next consumer read — dreaming scheduler picks up changes within ~1 min; threads/compose read on next request; session timeout applies to next session spawn. No daemon restart required.

The frontend surface lives in `web/src/features/settings/SettingsDialog.tsx` with `lib/api/settings.ts`, `hooks/settings.ts`, and a `settings` domain in `DataContext`.

### Agents page

The Agents page (`web/src/features/agents/`) shows the active agent roster plus pending enrollments. Each agent detail drawer now includes (Phase 2):

- **Repositories** — `repos` map from agent.yaml, shown as badge chips in the detail header.
- **System prompt** — read-only, collapsible. Sourced from the `system_prompt` field on the existing `GET /agents` response (additive Phase 2 field).

Teams membership editing (add/remove workers only — manager reassignment is founder-gated) is available via `PUT /settings/teams`, wrapping `TeamsRegistry` mutators with `validate_team_membership` consistency checks and 409 rollback on drift.

**Backend:** The `GET /agents` response now includes `repos` and `system_prompt` fields (additive, `allow_rules` remains excluded).

Build and dev commands:

```bash
scripts/build_web.sh
cd web && npm run dev
happyranch web
```

The SPA fetches the daemon bearer token once via `GET /api/v1/auth/bootstrap`, which is localhost-gated, then caches it in `sessionStorage` and attaches it to HTTP and SSE calls. CLI bearer-token behavior is unchanged.

## CLI

The CLI is an HTTP client. Start the daemon first.

```bash
scripts/daemon.sh start
scripts/daemon.sh status
scripts/daemon.sh stop --force     # graceful shutdown (default daemon needs --force)
happyranch web [--no-open]
```

Slug resolution for per-org commands: explicit `--org <slug>` > `HAPPYRANCH_ORG_SLUG` > auto-infer only when exactly one org exists > error. Container-level commands take no `--org`.

System assistant commands are container-level:

```bash
happyranch assistant init [--repair|--reconfigure]
happyranch assistant status
happyranch assistant
```

`happyranch assistant` attaches to the daemon-owned PTY for the runtime-global
system assistant. It does not take `--org`.

The same surface is founder-facing in the web app at `/orgs/:slug/assistant`
(`web/src/features/system-assistant/`): status / init / register / repair over the
four HTTP routes (now in `INCLUDED_PATHS` with TS mirrors in
`web/src/lib/api/assistant.ts`), plus an in-browser xterm.js terminal attached to the
`/assistant/session` WebSocket PTY. Because browsers cannot set the `Authorization`
header on `new WebSocket()`, the browser authenticates by offering the bearer token as
the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` subprotocol `happyranch.bearer.<token>` (THR-006 Option A);
the daemon validates and echoes it back. The WS route is not in OpenAPI (FastAPI omits
WS), so it is not part of the `openapi-coverage` route set. See
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-12-system-assistant-web-ui-design.md`.

Full founder-facing CLI docs: `skills/happyranch/SKILL.md`.

### PR CI wait / guarded merge entrypoints

Two CLI entrypoints (invoked as jobs or on task resume, not as `happyranch` subcommands) provide the PR CI polling and guarded-merge mechanisms:

```bash
# Poll job (submitted via happyranch jobs submit):
python -m runtime.daemon.pr_ci_waiter \
  --repo owner/repo --pr N --head-sha <40-char-sha> \
  --expected-check "Python CI" --expected-check "Web CI" \
  --timeout-seconds 3600 --settle-seconds 120 --poll-interval-seconds 15

# Merge (triggered by resumed task):
python -m runtime.daemon.pr_ci_merge \
  --org <org-slug> --repo owner/repo --pr N --head-sha <40-char-sha> \
  --merge-method squash --ci-verdict ci_pass \
  --review-task-id TASK-xxx --qa-task-id TASK-yyy
```

Both print structured JSON verdicts to stdout and exit with mapped codes (0 = success).
The poll job runs with `review_required=false` through the existing jobs path; agents never
get raw `gh pr merge` grants. The full workflow narrative (submit → blocked → resume → inspect →
merge/revise) is documented in `protocol/skills/jobs/SKILL.md` and
`docs/agent-guides/features-and-invariants.md`.

### Token usage

`happyranch tokens` shows `session_token_usage`. Default is the most recent rows;
a `--by-*` flag (mutually exclusive) switches to a rollup:

```bash
happyranch tokens --by-agent | --by-task | --by-thread | --by-purpose
```

`--by-purpose` groups by `invocation_purpose` (route `group_by=purpose`). Filters
(`--since`, `--thread-id`, `--agent`, `--purpose`, `--scope-type`,
`--scope-id`, `--task-id`) AND-compose with any view.

Rollup modifiers (presentation-side; require a `--by-*` flag):

- `--top N` — rank by churn (`total`) DESC and keep the top N; ties: sessions DESC then key ASC.
- `--over-threshold N` — keep only groups whose churn strictly exceeds N (applied **before** `--top`); empty result prints a "nothing would alert" line.

**Churn invariant:** `total = input + output + reasoning`. `CacheR`
(cache reads) rides in its own column and is **never** folded into `total`
or used to sort/threshold — it overstates burn ~10–100×.

The `--by-agent`/`--by-thread` rollups add a **Model** column
(none on `--by-task`/`--by-purpose`). Its label is classified at render time —
a single presentation constant `MODEL_FIX_CUTOVER_TS` draws the pre/post line,
never SQL:

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `<model-id>` | one observed model |
| `(mixed)` | >1 model, or observed+NULL mixed, or NULL spanning codex+claude |
| `(cli-unreported)` | all-NULL codex (codex emits no model field) |
| `(unknown — pre-fix)` | all-NULL claude, all before the cutover (frozen history) |
| `(unknown — ANOMALY)` | all-NULL claude, any at/after the cutover (parser-drift canary) |

The founder dashboard carries a read-only **Top token threads** card (a
window selector for 24h/7d/30d) backed by the same `/tokens?group_by=thread`
route. It ranks threads by churn (`total`) DESC client-side, shows cache reads
as a muted secondary number (never in the bar or the rank), and labels each
thread's Model with the same precedence as the CLI table above.

## Agent-Side Callbacks

These are invoked by skills inside agent sessions. Do not invoke them by hand; doing so falsifies audit data.

- `happyranch report-completion`
- `happyranch progress`
- `happyranch memory {add,update,promote,reindex}`
- `happyranch manage-agent`
- `happyranch manage-repo`
- `happyranch dispatch`
- `happyranch threads {reply,decline,dispatch}`

Callbacks should use `--from-file <path>` where payloads have multiple fields. **The path MUST be absolute** (e.g. `/tmp/completion.json`). A relative path silently resolves against the agent's cwd and can litter stray files under the runtime orgs root. The CLI rejects relative paths with a clear error in the callback family (`report-completion`, `threads reply/decline/dispatch/compose`). See `docs/agent-guides/agent-executors-and-permissions.md`.
